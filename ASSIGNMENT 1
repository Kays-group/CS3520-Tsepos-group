OBJECTIVE
The objective is to design and simulate a functional digital circuit that add two 2-bit binary numbers and produce a 3-bit output using
digital logic gates, and reveal report skills using modern collaboration and publishing platforms.

TESTING STRATEGY WITH TESTING CASES
We used sequence generator to add all our inputs to the half adders and also used LED to determine our outputs. When the LED lights 
red the output is 1 and when the LED does not light the output is 0.The outputs we obtained when using a sequence generator 
corresponds to those we obtained when adding numbers manually in either decimal form or binary form .
And the 2-bit binary numbers that were used to test our adder are 00,01,10,11.
The expected 3-bit number when adding 0 and 1 is 1 and 00 + 01 = 01
The expected 3-bit  number when adding 2 and 3 is 5 and 10 + 11 = 105
With these test cases, we verified that our 2-bit binary adder gives expected outcomes

CHALLENGES FACED
In order for us to add a carry from the first half adder and the sum of the most significant bit from the second adder, we had to 
include another exclusive-or-gate.

CONCLUTION
This project effectively demonstrated our capabilities in designing, simulating, and documenting a digital curcuit that operates 
as a 2-bit binary adder using fundamental digital logic gates. By incorporating two half adders and a single OR gate, we 
successfully achieved the task of adding two 2-bit binary numbers and producing a 3-bit output, which includes both sum bits and 
the carry-out bit.
